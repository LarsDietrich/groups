Notes on groups.ie

Should use google places api for venues

to debug an sql statement use the following code

 $this->getDbTable()->getAdapter()->setProfiler(true);
//execute run query
then call
// echo $this->getDbTable()->getAdapter()->getProfiler()->getLastQueryProfile()->getQuery();


css and js

to add js or css to a page use from controller
$this->view->css[] = new Application_Model_Css("something.css");
and for javascript
$this->view->js[] = new Application_Model_Js("something.js");

you can add defaults in the bootstrap.php _initLayout() I've added style.css and also the latest jquery

The layout script will then ensure these are included in your page
